Simple automation task:

Used in my work to take the .CSV files and prepare the associated rake task (for our Ruby on rails development environment), folders and populate those folders. 
<br> This rake task will be later used to migrate the data to our RDS DB. 

Python Modules:
<br>pathlib
<br>shutil
<br>os
