Simple automation task:

Used in my work to take the .CSV files and prepare the associated rake task (for our Ruby on rails development environment), folders and populate those folders. 
\n This rake task will be later used to migrate the data to our RDS DB. 

Modules:
\npathlib
\nshutil
\nos
\nfileinput
